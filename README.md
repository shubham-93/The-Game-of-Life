# The-Game-of-Life
Simulation of the Game of Life in Python and C.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton whose evolution is determined just by an initial state of living and dead cells.

The game rules:

1) Each cell has 8 neighbors: 1 top, 1 bottom, 1 left, 1 right, and 4 in the diagonal corners.
2) Any living cell with less than 2 or more than 3 neighbors dies. Other living cells survive.
3) Any dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors comes alive.

These simple rules give rise to many interesting and complicated patterns.
